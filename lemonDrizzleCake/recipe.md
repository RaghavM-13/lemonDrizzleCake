STEP 1
Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4.

STEP 2
Beat together the butter and caster sugar until pale and creamy, then add the eggs, one at a time, slowly mixing through.

STEP 3
Sift in the self-raising flour, then add the lemon zest and mix until well combined.

STEP 4
Line a loaf tin (8 x 21cm) with greaseproof paper, then spoon in the mixture and level the top with a spoon.

STEP 5
Bake for 45-50 mins until a thin skewer inserted into the centre of the cake comes out clean.

STEP 6
While the cake is cooling in its tin, mix together the lemons juice and caster sugar to make the drizzle.

STEP 7
Prick the warm cake all over with a skewer or fork, then pour over the drizzle â€“ the juice will sink in and the sugar will form a lovely, crisp topping.

STEP 8
Leave in the tin until completely cool, then remove and serve. Will keep in an airtight container for 3-4 days, or freeze for up to 1 month.
